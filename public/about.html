<h1 style="color:872341 ;">About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a college student currently diving into the world of web development. I'm passionate about designing websites
   and eager to learn how they work, particularly how to make them engaging and user-friendly. While I'm still in the learning phase,
    I find front-end development exciting, and I'm focused on mastering HTML and CSS at the moment. I'm currently taking
    a full-stack development course by Angela Yu, where I'm building foundational skills and working on small projects that help me grow.</p>

<p>Though I'm not working on any large personal projects yet, I'm constantly exploring new concepts and practicing by creating simple, 
  90's-style HTML and CSS websites. My goal is to eventually become a full-stack developer, and I’m excited to dive deeper into Node.js 
  as part of my journey. I’m always looking forward to expanding my skill set and creating beautiful, functional websites!</p>
